# Rusty Edge
This purpose of this project is to solve the edge computing problem. The first use case is for doing simple computing of IOT signals on a relatively small device such as a rasberry pi. The first attempt is written in Python with a more optimized attempt here being done in Rust. If Rust proves a decent implementation Python bindings will follow. Currently the project is still in a research phase to judge the applicability of Rust to the problem space.
